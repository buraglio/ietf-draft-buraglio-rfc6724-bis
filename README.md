# ietf-draft-buraglio-rfc6724-bis
## Proposed adjustments to RFC6724

### Adjust section 10.6, make it mandatory rather than optional 
### Other potential changes:
#### Provide mechanism for the network to be able to signal local prefixes, ideally more than one /48 
#### Add verbiage for allowing a shorter (/40) ULA prefix to be considered local
